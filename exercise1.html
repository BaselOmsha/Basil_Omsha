    <h2 class="center">Core competence</h2>
    <p class="center">Core competence studies and thesis are compulsory for all Computer Applications degree students.
        Work placement
        also belongs to core competence. The core competence studies cover a wide range of topics in programming. You
        will learn programming languages and techniques
        most commonly used today. Studies include also e.g. user interface design, operating systems, web development,
        databases, cloud operations, software robotics, business and innovation.</p>

    <h2 class="center">Profiling competence</h2>

        career goals.
        After core competence studies, you will select studies according to your own interests and focus with the
        following profiling competences:

    </ul>

        University Centre is modern,
        safe and cozy which makes studying here enjoyable.</p>
