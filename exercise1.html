    <p class="center">Core competence studies and thesis are compulsory for all Computer Applications degree students.
        Work placement
        also belongs to core competence. The core competence studies cover a wide range of topics in programming. You
        will learn programming languages and techniques
        most commonly used today. Studies include also e.g. user interface design, operating systems, web development,
