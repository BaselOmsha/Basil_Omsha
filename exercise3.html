            <p>
                HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
                It is the fifth and last[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
                The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard.
                It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the
                major browser vendors (Apple,
                Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).
            </p>

            <p>
                HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] with a major update and "W3C
                Recommendation"
                status in October 2014.[4][5] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest
                multimedia and other new features; to keep the
                language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web
                browsers, parsers, etc.,
                without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to
                subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1
                and DOM Level 2 HTML.[6]
            </p>

            <p>
                HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends,
                improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application
                programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[7] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a
                candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed with low-powered
                devices in mind.
